        <h1>My name is Gabriel Nicholson</h1>  
        <p>I dont have any experiance writing code at all untill this semester. I've played with the inspect element feature on websites before but that is about the limit of my HTML knowlage. I am exited to learn more about website making and coding this semester and hope that i can keep up with the course.</p>
        <p>I was born is Marshel North Carolina just down the french broad from Asheville, I've lived in western North Carolina my whole life and grew up in Asheville.</p>
        <p>My favorite project from NM101 was the collage project which i think was the first one we did. I liked it the most because I put way to much effort into just one of my collages and it came out looking really nice, its still one of my favorite peices of art i have made yet.</p>

        <h3>Websites I like: Terraria Wiki</h3>
        <p>https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki</p>
        <p>I really like this website because i use it all the time to help me metagame in Terraria. It is a very easy to navigate website with tons of information but my favorite feature is the random page button which will just send you to a random article withen the wiki, its good for learning about new things in the game and fun to browse idly</p>
        
        <h3>Websites I dont like: Youtube to MP3 converter</h3>
        <p>https://ytmp3.cc/85bb1/</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that I use this website often, I still think it is a poor site. It often will fail to convert videos at all when i try to process them and even when it does, it will usually trick you into opening up spam tabs when you try to retrieve the converted file.</p>
